## Other Things I Want To Say

If you encounter a bug that crashes your game and can be stably reproduced, please report in issues and I'll fix as soon
as I can.

Feature requests will NOT be accepted easily because I made this mod for myself. I won't add features I don't need or
there's a better option for the feature in every aspect. If you would like to commit a pull request, please ask if I
would merge in the issues before you actually do that. (Feel free to fork as long as you follow GPLv2)

To code this mod, I learned many new things for the first time, such as Kotlin, Mixin, Gradle, Git, GUI design and so
on. Maybe it's not good, but I'm trying my best. Hope you enjoy.
